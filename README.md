# Mintacoin

![banner][banner-img]

[**Mintacoin**][www] is a minimalist and open-source API that abstracts the blockchain complexity and provides a simple and reliable infrastructure layer to mint your crypto assets and process payments with them.

Abstracting the blockchain complexity away, and combining the power of Elixir and Stellar, Mintacoin provides a simple and reliable infrastructure layer to mint crypto assets and process payments with them.

Reach the power of blockchain with just an API integration!

## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Run the tests with `mix test`.
