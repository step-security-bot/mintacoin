[**Mintacoin**][www] is a minimalist and open-source API that abstracts the blockchain complexity by providing a simple and reliable infrastructure layer to mint your crypto assets and process payments with them.

Reach the power of blockchain with just an API integration! 🪄

## What can you do with Mintacoin?

Mintacoin will provide endpoints so you can:
- Create accounts.
- Create crypto assets.
- Process payments.

Mintacoin operates on the [Stellar blockchain][stellar], you only have to worry about two custom keys we'll give you: an **address** and a **signature**. 👌

## Motivation

The adoption of Web3 implies technical knowledge specific to each technology, ecosystem, or protocol. This results into:

- High technical complexity.
- Time and effort.
- Slow time to market, therefore high development costs.

Mintacoin aims to solve these current Web3 issues!

## Why Mintacoin?

Web3 needs additional infrastructure layers that facilitate the user experience (UX) in the use of blockchain technologies.

Mintacoin offers a simple and reliable infrastructure layer, so people can focus on their core business and not on the issues previously described. 🚀

## What do we want to achieve?

- Make straightforward the adoption of Web3 technologies for developers by proposing interaction with a REST API rather than a blockchain.

- Reduce technical complexity, costs, and time to the market for solutions around crypto assets.

## Documentation

Mintacoin's documentation is available here: [docs.mintacoin.co](https://docs.mintacoin.co)

## Roadmap

To know the current status of the project, you can check Mintacoin's roadmap here: [**ROADMAP**][roadmap] 🗺️

> The current release for the project is the version **v0.5.1**.

## Development

Here we will show up the Mintacoin's setup for development purposes, follow the next steps:

### Requirements

- Elixir <= v1.14
- Erlang <= 24.3
- PostgreSQL >= v14 (latest)

#### Setting up

1. Mintacoin requires a development configuration file. Copy the example with the `cp config/dev.exs.example config/dev.exs`.

2. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`.

3. Within the file `dev.exs` replace the following variables:

    - **`"STELLAR_FUND_SECRET_KEY"`**: Is the secret key from a stellar account with funds, you can create and fund one here: [Stellar Laboratory][stellar-laboratory].
    - **`"BLOCKCHAINS_NETWORK"`**: Is the place where the transactions has effect, for development purposes, place this value `:testnet`.
    - **`"API_TOKEN"`**: Is the authorization token for the API requests, you can generate a secure token by running `mix phx.gen.secret 32`.

4. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`.

5. Run the project in a terminal with `iex -S mix` and add the next record with `Mintacoin.Blockchains.create(%{name: "stellar", network: "testnet"})`.

6. Finally, start the Phoenix server with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

#### Testing

Run the tests with `mix test`.

#### Setting up with Docker

1. First, you need to execute steps **2** and **3** from the previous setup.

2. Build the Phoenix and Postgres images with `docker-compose build`.

3. Finally, run the containers `docker-compose up`.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser (only if port 4000 is available).

#### Testing with Docker

Run the tests with `docker-compose run mintacoin_api mix test`.

#### Run commands with Docker
* Run the IEx console with `docker-compose run mintacoin_api iex -S mix`.
* Run your new migrations with `docker-compose run mintacoin_api mix ecto.migrate`.
* Install new dependencies with `docker-compose run mintacoin_api mix deps.get`.
* Run any mix task with `docker-compose run mintacoin_api mix <task>`.
